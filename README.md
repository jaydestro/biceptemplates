# biceptemplates

This is a place for me to put in my [Bicep Tempaltes](https://cda.ms/29k) that I create.

Bicep is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for creating your Azure resources. While many different methods may select programming languages such as Ruby, Bicep really aims to reduce complexity by introducing a cleaner syntax for you to reuse your code more often. Bicep is a **transparent abstraction** of ARM templates, which differs from using another general-purpose programming language. Bicep uses Azure Resource Templates (ARM template) files in JSON to compile and deploy your desired infrastructure.
